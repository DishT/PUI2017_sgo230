1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null hypothesis
The average BMI decrease in subjects who were assigned to a regimen of exercise was equal to or higher than the average BMI decrease in subjects who were assigned to dieting

H0: Pt <= Pc

Alternative hypothesis:
The average BMI decrease for subjects assigned to dieting was higher than the average decrease in BMI for subjects who were assigned to exercising

H1: Pt > Pc


2. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimental setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

Null Hypothesis:
The average IQ of children whose parents do not smoke is equal to or less than the average IQ or children whose parents smoke

Alternative Hypothesis:

The average IQ of children whose parents smoke [add measure of 'smoke'] is lower than the average IQ of children whose parents do not smoke

H0:
Mean IQ scores for children whose mothers smoke (10+ cigarettes a day) during pregnancy as the same as the mean for children whose mothers do not smoke

H1: Mean IQ scores for children whose mothers smoke (10+ cigarettes a day) is statistically (in)distinguishable from whose who mothers do not smoke

Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

#This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

H0: there is no spatial correlation between the prevalance of diabetes and the distribution of food deserts

H1: there is a higher incidence of diabetes in prximity to food deserts.
